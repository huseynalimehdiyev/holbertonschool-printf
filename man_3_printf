.SH NAME
_printf \- formatted output conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.sp
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B _printf
function produces output according to a \fIformat\fR as described below. This function writes output to \fBstdout\fR, the standard output stream.
.PP
The \fIformat\fR string is a character string, starting and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not \fB%\fR), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.
.PP
Each conversion specification is introduced by the character \fB%\fR and ends with a conversion specifier.
.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
The following conversion specifiers are currently supported:
.TP
.B c
The \fBint\fR argument is converted to an \fBunsigned char\fR, and the resulting character is written.
.TP
.B s
The \fBconst char *\fR argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of characters (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) the terminating null byte. If the pointer is \fBNULL\fR, the string \fB(null)\fR is written.
.TP
.B %
A \fB%\fR is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is \fB%%\fR.
.TP
.B d, i
The \fBint\fR argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, the
.B _printf
function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
.PP
If an output error is encountered, a value of \fB\-1\fR is returned.
.SH EXAMPLES
.B _printf("Character:[%c]\\n", 'H');
.br
Output: Character:[H]
.PP
.B _printf("String:[%s]\\n", "I am a string!");
.br
Output: String:[I am a string!]
.PP
.B _printf("Decimal:[%d]\\n", 1024);
.br
Output: Decimal:[1024]
.SH BUGS
Does not handle flag characters, field width, precision, or length modifiers.
